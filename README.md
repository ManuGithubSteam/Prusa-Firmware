# Prusa Firmware MK3 - modiefied to work better wit Vocano Mod

USE AT OWN RISK!

I had to tinker a bit after installing the volcano because the Pinda would not find the bed sometimes. So this are my fixes. They work for ME.

I try to rebase this if new Firmware comes out.

This is made for this Slicer Profile section here: https://github.com/ManuGithubSteam/Slic3rSettings_Prusa_Different_Filaments

Have fun.
